## Getting started

Run `npm install` before first start.

Run `nx dev` to start the development server. Happy coding!

Run `nx build` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

### Code notes

- When logging in, `username` is stored as a cookie on the server.
- Pages and routes are organized via the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) structure (nextjs 13+).
- Users can only edit and delete their own posts. This is checked against the user's username, and enforced by not showing the necessary ui elements.
- Click on any country to see its product/country score (defaults to 50).
- Toggle through the products at the bottom of the map screen or from the dropdown in the score modal.
